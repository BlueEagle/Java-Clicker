# Java-Clicker
I made this on a whim so I can click apps in BlueStacks (an android emulator for PC).

This is useful for automating clicks. It was slightly more intelligent than existing solutions and was more fun to make than it would have been worth to find an existing solution.

I consider this project complete since it has served my purpose.
